I have used Google Colab as the platform for working. 
Choosed the data set Hotel Bookings
In this Assignment I have worked on SQL and Spark codes paralally which can distinguish the clear difference in the SQL and Spark codes
Also Apache Spark has as its architectural foundation the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed
over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD,
followed by the Dataset API.
